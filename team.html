        <h2 id="#introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p class="lead">
            This page describes the Gammapy project organisation and the main roles and responsibilities in the Gammapy
            team.
        </p>
        <p>
            This structure was put in place in December 2017 based on our experience developing Gammapy since 2013,
            as well more generally with science tool software development in the <a
                href="https://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/hfm/HESS/">H.E.S.S.</a>
            and <a href="https://www.cta-observatory.org/">CTA</a> collaborations. We also took inspiration from the way
            the <a href="http://www.astropy.org/team.html">Astropy</a> and <a
                href="http://sunpy.org/team.html">Sunpy</a>
            projects are organised, since they are in a similar situation as Gammapy: a distributed development team and
            a variety of people and projects using and depending on them.
        </p>
        <p>
            We expect this structure to evolve over the coming years, adapting to
            the size and composition of the Gammapy development team, and the requirements and needs of scientists and
            projects using Gammapy. If you would like to become part of the Gammapy team, please get in <a
                href="contact.html">contact</a>.
            Help is always welcome!
        </p>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The following sections describe the major roles and responsibilities in the Gammapy team:

        </ul>

        <h2 id="cc">Coordination Committee</h2>
        <p class="lead">
            The Gammapy coordination committee (CC) is the board that is responsible to promote, coordinate and steer
            Gammapy developments. It also serves as main contact point for the Gammapy project.
        </p>
        <p>
            Gammapy is developed and used by people and projects from several institutes and countries, with different
            needs, priorities and schedules. Members of the CC are representatives for the major stakeholders, i.e.
            groups that have contributed significantly to Gammapy development, as well as projects like H.E.S.S. and CTA
            that are using Gammapy. In addition, the Gammapy project manager and lead developer are part of the Gammapy
            CC.
        </p>
        <p>
            Responsibilities include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Ensure that scientists and projects that are using Gammapy have reliable, good and long-term support
            </li>
            <li>
                Promote the use of Gammapy by new projects, especially as science tool for CTA
            </li>
            <li>
                Support and grow the Gammapy team (help find manpower and funding)
            </li>
            <li>
                Make decisions on the scope, content and development priorities for the Gammapy package. <br>
                In many cases this will be done via documents we call "proposals for improvement of Gammapy (PIGs)".
            </li>
            <li>
                Support and coordinate the use of Gammapy for scientific or technical studies and papers
            </li>
            <li>
                The CC is the official contact point for the Gammapy project.
            </li>
            <li>
                Appoint the Gammapy project manager (technical lead) and lead developer (non-technical lead)
            </li>
            <li>
                CC members should join the Gammapy CC mailing list and calls for important discussions <br>
                (day-to-day management is left to the project manager and technical lead).
            </li>

        <h2 class="project-manager">Project manager</h2>
        <p class="lead">
            The project manager is the non-technical executive lead for the Gammapy project.
        </p>
        <p>
            The project manager is appointed by the Gammapy coordination committee, and works closely with the Gammapy
            coordination committee, core developers and users.

            <li>
                Organise and drive all non-technical aspects of the project on a day-to-day basis.
                Keep the overview of ongoing activities, schedules and action items and follow up
                to make sure all important things get done.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve as Gammapy coordination committee secretary (schedule and moderate calls; give status reports;

            </li>
            <li>
                Keep an overview and help coordinate all activities that have some involvement of Gammapy,
                such as e.g. papers, presentations or posters about or using Gammapy at gamma-ray astronomy meetings or
                conferences, or tutorials at schools / workshops on gamma-ray astronomy data analysis.
            </li>
            <li>
                Maintain Gammapy communication channels (mailing lists, slack, github, ...)

        <p>
            The current project manager is <strong>Roberta Zanin</strong>, the deputy project manager is <strong>Bruno
            Khelifi</strong>.
        </p>
        <p class="small">
            The role of project manager is very time-intensive. The project manager and deputy should aim to distribute
            tasks to
            other contributors in the Gammapy team, and split the remaining work.
        </p>

        <h2 id="lead-developer">Lead developer</h2>
        <p class="lead">
            The lead developer is the technical executive lead for the Gammapy project.
        </p>
        <p>
            The lead developer is appointed by the Gammapy coordination committee, and works closely with the Gammapy
            coordination committee, project manager, core developers and community contributors.
        </p>
        <p>
            Responsibilities include:

            <li>
                Organise and drive all technical aspects of the project on a day-to-day basis.

            </li>
            <li>
                Propose and outline development activities for Gammapy, e.g. by writing, co-authoring
                or reviewing "proposal for improvement of Gammapy (PIGs)" documents.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve on the Gammapy coordination committee, as the link between CC and the development team.
                Present and explain PIGs to the CC, and make a recommendation.
            </li>
            <li>
                Manage the Gammapy developer / maintainer / contributor team. Motivate and assign responsibilities to
                other core developers to maintain sub-packages of Gammapy and to review incoming pull requests
                or take on a mentoring role for new Gammapy contributors.
            </li>
            <li>
                Grow and teach the Gammapy developer and contributor team, e.g. via calls or chat,
                or code review on Github, or via presentations and tutorials at Gammapy developer meetings.
            </li>
            <li>
                Maintain <a href="http://docs.gammapy.org/">docs.gammapy.org</a>, especially the developer
                documentation. How things work should be well-documented, processes (e.g. making a release,
                updating the docs) should be either fully automated, or mostly automated, and a checklist
                of simple steps available that any core developer can do.
            </li>
            <li>
                Work on Gammapy code and test improvements and clean up, prioritising things that are urgent
                or difficult and therefore unlikely to be done by others soon.
            </li>
            <li>
                Schedule and do Gammapy releases, taking needs of people and projects using Gammapy
                as well as available manpower for developments into account.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The current lead developer is <strong>Christoph Deil</strong>, the deputy lead developer is
            <strong>tbd</strong>.
        </p>
        <p class="small">
            The role of lead developer is very time-intensive. The lead developer and deputy should aim to distribute
            tasks to
            other core developers and contributors in the Gammapy team, and split the remaining work.
        </p>

        <h2 id="core-developers">Core developers</h2>
        <p class="lead">The Gammapy core developers regularly contribute to Gammapy, either by writing code, tests or
            documentation themselves, or by doing review, maintenance, refactoring or cleanup for parts of the Gammapy
            code.</p>
        <p>
            The Gammapy core developers are PhD students, postdocs or researchers with a permanent position in gamma-ray
            astronomy that spend a certain fraction of their time on Gammapy. The role of Gammapy core developer isn't
            well-defined, there is a continuous spectrum from Gammapy contributors that make one small pull request to
            Gammapy, to Gammapy core developers that spend a large fraction of their work time on Gammapy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore, we do not try to draw a line here and present a list of all core developers.
            However, to give some credit and to encourage contributors to help improve the quality of the existing
            Gammapy code, tests and documentation, we do give a list here of the major Gammapy sub-packages,
            and for each sub-package list a lead and where available deputy maintainer. The goal is to have
            every sub-package covered, so if you are familiar with one of these sub-packages, and have some time
            to work on it within the coming months, please sign up by contacting the Gammapy lead developer!
        </p>
        <p>
            It is important to note that no-one "owns" a given sub-package or piece of code in Gammapy. Everyone is
            welcome to make a proposal or pull request for any file in Gammapy at any time and it is an explicit goal
            that all parts of the Gammapy codebase are easy to understand and contribute to by new people!
        </p>
        <p>
            By agreeing to maintain a given sub-package for Gammapy, you express to do the following on a best-effort
            basis (roughly sorted by priority):
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fix known bugs</li>
            <li>
                Review and integrate open pull requests with fixes or features.
            </li>
            <li>
                Review and improve the existing code, tests and documentation.
            </li>
            <li>
                If needed, plan and execute major developments, such as new features or re-writes.
                If useful, write a "proposal for improvement of Gammapy (PIG)" first.
                This is rare, and will usually be done only after discussion with and in collaboration with other
                Gammapy developers and the Gammapy lead developer.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Ideally each sub-package has a lead and deputy maintainer, and they pair-code or review each other's pull
            requests.
